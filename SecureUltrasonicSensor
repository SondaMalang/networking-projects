Building and Securing an Ultrasonic Sensor Node

Research Phase:
Identify available Arduino libraries for encryption and password protection.
-PSACrypto, Password
Investigate Python libraries for handling the corresponding decryption and verification.
-Scapy, Nmap, Requests, BeautifulSoup, PyCrypto, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, Cryptography

Preparation:
Set up your Arduino development environment.
Install the necessary Python libraries in your development environment.

Data Collection on Arduino:
Write code to collect sensor data.
Create a placeholder for a user-defined password or key.

Encryption Implementation on Arduino:
Select a simple encryption method (e.g., a basic symmetric algorithm).
Integrate the encryption library into your Arduino code.
Encrypt the sensor data using the chosen method and the stored key/password.

Transmission Setup:
Configure the Arduino to send the encrypted data over the chosen communication channel.
Ensure that the data packet includes any necessary metadata (e.g., an identifier for the encryption method used).

Python Receiver Development:
Write a Python script to receive the transmitted data.
Integrate the corresponding decryption library into the Python script.

Decryption Process:
Implement a function in Python to decrypt the received data using the pre-shared password or key.
Verify that the decrypted data matches the original sensor readings.

Testing & Debugging:
Test the entire transmission process, from sensor reading to decryption.
Log and debug any issues at each stage (data collection, encryption, transmission, decryption).

Documentation:
Document each step of the process.
Create a flowchart or diagram that shows the data flow and security measures applied.
